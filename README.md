# GogoLoot

Don't let Loot slow down your zug!

### :gem:  **KEY FEATURES**

* A Classic WoW addon to help speed up runs by automating your Need and Greed Rolls on BoEs.

* There's also an ignore list so you don't miss manual rolls on important items like bags or patterns.

### :package: **INSTALLATION**

1. **Find your WoW Classic Era AddOns folder:**
   - Windows: `C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_era_\Interface\AddOns` (default, may be different)
   - macOS: `/Applications/World of Warcraft/_classic_era_/Interface/AddOns`
   - Or use Battle.net: Click the gear icon next to "Play" → "Show in Explorer" (Windows) or "Show in Finder" (macOS) → Navigate to `_classic_era_/Interface/AddOns`

2. **Extract the ZIP file:**
   - **Important:** Extract directly into your `AddOns` folder
   - Make sure the folder structure after extraction is: `AddOns/GogoLoot_Classic_Era_Lite/` (with all the addon files inside)
   - If you see `AddOns/GogoLoot_Classic_Era_Lite/GogoLoot_Classic_Era_Lite/`, you've double-nested it - move the inner folder up one level

3. **Verify installation:**
   - Launch WoW Classic Era
   - At the character selection screen, click "AddOns" button (bottom left)
   - Make sure "GogoLoot - Classic Era Lite" is listed and enabled
